This project's build is in the dist folder, but the JRE's modules weren't pushed because it was a too big file!

## If you haven't played battle ships before
Battle Ships is a turn based tactical game where you have to sink the other player's ships!
After you start playing you can shoot at the enemy's territory and if you find a ship it will light up blue. If you sink a ship the whole ship will turn red. <br> Side note: two separate ships can't be adjacent to eachother. Use this info to your advantage!
